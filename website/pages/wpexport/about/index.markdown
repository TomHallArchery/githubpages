This is a blog about competitive archery. A phrase I never thought I'd say. It will include updates on my progress over the next few years, as well as thoughts on coaching, technique, equipment, psychology and sport in general. I hope you find it interesting!

Of course a lot of work goes into this project and I am extremely grateful for all the supportÂ I receive; these are some of the generous people who are helping me on the journey.
