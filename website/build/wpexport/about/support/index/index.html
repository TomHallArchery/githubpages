<p>These are some of the generous people who make competing at an international level that bit easier for me.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/sport/teamwarwick/performance/">Warwick Sport Performance Program </a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: October 2013</p>
<p>I was part of the Warwick Sport scholarship program for four years while competing as an athlete for the university, and in that time they have done a great deal for me, especially in the provision of S&amp;C and physio support, and through bursaries that have helped fund crucial equipment and three caps for the GBR student team at World Universities events.</p>
<p>Now I have graduated but I am still involved with the performance sport program, both as an archery coach and through a placement with the growing S&amp;C team. With their support, my goal is to learn as much as I can and apply the findings to both my own training and those who I support.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.clickersarchery.co.uk/">Clickers Archery</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: July 2015</p>
<p>Clickers have long been a major supporter of student archery, helping fantastic events like BUTC happen every year and helping clubs with their equipment. Personally they have always given me fantastic service too, helping me find the right equipment, ordering it in from distributors and posting it at lightning pace.

<h2><a href="http://www.gilloarchery.it/">Gillo Gold Medal</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: January 2017
Products used: GS6 and GS8 stabilisers
Blog posts: <a href="https://tomhall2016.wordpress.com/2017/06/27/gillo-gs6-stabilisers-review/">GS6 review</a></p>
<p>GILLO provide me with high quality stabilisation and accessories. The GS6 family is the lighter and well suited to lower poundage and intermediate budgets, though they also worked excellently for me at 45lbs. The newer GS8s are even thinner, more weighty and even more effective at damping the bow, they are the best stabiliser I have seen for recurve bows. Nothing I have seen or used has come close to the quality of these.</p>

<h2><a href="http://en.errea.com/brand/3dwear/">Errea Active Tense</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: Febuary 2017
Products used: Active Tense shooting shirt, Lite Recovery Shirt</p>
<p>Errea are a well-developed clothing brand, but their active tense line is an exciting new product for archery as well as other sports. Their shooting tops have an built in exoskeleton of material that acts in a similar way to KT tape, providing support to key points across the upper back, shoulders and arms. Their recovery tops combine targeted compression with some of the back support of the shooting top, relieving pressure on sore shoulders after shooting and increasing the speed of muscle recovery. I have made a lot of use of both since I got them and would recommend them to any archer!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.elivanes.it/">Elivanes</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: March 2017
Products used: P3 and S3 fletchings.</p>
<p>I've been using P3 Elivanes since 2013 for their durability compared to other spin-fletchings. They can take an absolute pounding, passthroughs or shots through the clicker and still group great, light, colourful and easy to put on. Now available in a variety of shapes for all purposes, I like the S3 vanes for close distance or indoors, while P3s remain my favourite for outdoors, field archery and general purpose use.</p>

<h2><a href="http://xsightarchery.com">X-Sight Archery</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: February 2018
Products used: Pro Performance Archery Glasses</p>
<p>Being the kind of person who can squint walking outside on an overcast day in England in November can make life on the archery field difficult. I spent a long time looking for glasses that were comfortable to wear and did not obstruct my view of the target, and now I'm very glad that I've found them. Come the outdoor season you'll find me wearing these almost every single day and that means they are just as important to me as the bow itself.</p>

<h2>Carbon Express Arrows</h2>
<p>Sponsor from: March 2018
Products used: Nano-Pro Extreme arrows
Blog posts: <a href="https://tomhall2016.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/on-test-easton-vs-cx/">On Test: Easton vs Carbon Express</a></p>
<p>In the early part of the 2018 season I spent a while testing out a set of arrows borrowed from GBR teammate Patrick Huston. Little did I know that the blog post I wrote up on it would be shared all across the world, and become by far the most popular article on the site. Those same arrows have now gone with me to every competition since then, and they continue to find their way into the ten both indoors and out.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.fivics.com">Fivics</a></h2>
<p>Sponsor from: May 2018
Products used: Titan EX riser and Limbs. SM540 button, Saker II tab, Accendo Field Quiver.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be given the chance to try the new Titan EX bow as it was released, and it took me less than a week to both set a new PB and fall in love with it. Since then the "Pink Panther" as I call it, has been by my side through my best year yet in 2018, including two World Cup medals and the British No 1 ranking throughout the entire outdoor season. After trying a few different bows before this I am really happy I've found something I can trust.</p>
